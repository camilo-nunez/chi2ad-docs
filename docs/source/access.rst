Access to the Cluster
=====================

Login
~~~~~
You can log into Chi2AD with the following ssh command, replacing `<uid>` with your username:

```
[client@localhost]% ssh login.hpc.chivo.cl -l <uid>
```

After having logged into Chi2AD, you will find yourself on the login node `chi2ad-login-01`. The login node serve as the front ends to the compute nodes of the HPC cluster. They are intended for the editing and compilation of source code files.

Login Shell
~~~~~~~~~~~
The default login shell for new Chi2AD users is `bash`. A login bash shell looks for `.bash_profile`, `.bash_login` or `.profile`` in your home directory and executes commands from the first file found. A non-login bash shell or bash subshell reads `.bashrc` file.

Headnode
~~~~~~~~
In the headnode (A.K.A. `chi2ad-headnode-01`), the users can interact with the cluster. You can log into the `chi2ad-headnode-01` with the following ssh command:

```
[<uid>@chi2ad-login-01]% ssh chi2ad-headnode-01.internal.chivo.cl
```

The typical tasks and settings that can be put in the shell setup files are for example:

* Creation of a custom prompt
* Modification of search path for external commands and programs
* Definition of environment variables needed by programs or scripts
* Definition of aliases
* Execution of commands (e.g. `module load <modname>/<version>`).

.. warning::
    Never run your customs scripts or compute scripts in the headnode.

Interactive shell on Compute Node
---------------------------------
If you need an interactive bash session on a compute node, you need to run the following command in the `chi2ad-headnode-01`:

```
[<uid>@chi2ad-headnode-01]% srun -p compute-node-A --time=HH:MM:SS --mem=nnG --pty bash
```
Where `HH:MM:SS` are hours, minutes and seconds, and `nnG` are the memory in gigabytes to allocate (10G, 32G, etc.).

Close the shell when you are done. If you donâ€™t, the process will keep running until your time limit. All of this time will be counted against your usage.
