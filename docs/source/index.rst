Introduction
------------

What is CHIVO?
~~~~~~~~~~
The Chilean Virtual Observatory (CHIVO) is a VO developed in Chile and it is one of many VO projects currently underway in the world. It was born out of the need to archive data that require large storage capacities and the need to develop new tools for the analyzing large volumes of data and better algorithms for intelligent processing of astronomical data, this due to the volumes of large scale data that will generate the astronomical observatories in Chile, mainly the ALMA project that will generate over 1TB of data per day, and in this form be to able to store the data in the local territory to optimize the observation time of the chilean astronomers.

Chivo is an initiative of the five most prestigious universities in the country, supported by the private institutions ALMA and REUNA. In addition of the use of the VO by scientists of astronomy area, the VO will be useful too for the students of schools, especially of schools of rural areas.

What is the VO?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Virtual Observatory (VO) is a network constructed by many different people and organisations and spread all over the world explore astronomical data in a single transparent system. The VO will facilitate astronomy research inquiring multiple data centers in a seamless way, providing new powerful and efficient research click here now. The VO gives datacenters a standard framework for publishing and delivering service using their data by standarization of data and metadata by standardization of data exchange methods, and by the use of a registry, which lists available services and what can be done with them. The data will be available to all researchers, independent of their affiliation or access to observing facilities.

About ChiVO
~~~~~~~~~~~
The Virtual Observatory Network is an international initiative designed to hold all astronomy data in a single, transparent system, making the data available to all researchers regardless of their affiliation or access to observation facilities.

The Chilean Virtual Observatory (ChiVO) is one of many now in development around the world. The scientific data obtained from ALMA are the property of the lead researcher on each observation proposal for one year. After that time, the data become public and any scientist may request access to them.

About Chi2AD
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The China-Chile Astronomical Data Center (Chi2AD) is the first data center affiliated to ChiVO. The datacenter has the objective of providing storage and processing capacities to the local and foreign astronomers, including mirroring astronomical data generated in Chile. Most of ChiVO services are currently hosted in this data center, and specifically part of the ALMA data is currently replicated here and accessed through VO services. This is a joint project between CASSACA and the UTFSM.\\

Briefly, the data center consist in:
* 860 TB of storage space for hosting actual data.
* 112 cores and 1 TB of total RAM for high-performance computing processing.
* 48 cores and 250GB of total RAM for services and managment.
* Infiniband and Ethernet GE/10GE networks.
* 10 Gigabit connection to Internet (national and international) provide by REUNA.

Cluster Nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Chi2AD was brought into operation in 2014 and consists of 8 compute nodes. Each node has two sockets, equipped with an \texttt{Intel Xeon E5-2680 v3 2.50GHz} 14 cores processor (Haswell). The peak performance of the system is 4.48 `TFLOPS/s`.

Different kinds of nodes are available to users: 1 login nodes and 2 nodes for virtualization machines. See Table \ref{tab:1:1} for a listing of the specifics of different node types.
